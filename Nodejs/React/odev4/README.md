# Emoji Search test
---
##
I have prepared a React test for the Emoji Search App to check its components. These checks consist of two main parts:

1. Header
2. Functions
For the Header section, I am checking if the header is being rendered correctly. For the SearchInput and EmojiResults components, I am testing if they are functional and renderable."
